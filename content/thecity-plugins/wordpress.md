# The City WordPress Plugin


## The Code

It is possible to pull church needs, topics, events, prayers and albums from the Plaza so that you can use them within your WordPress site.

Data pulled from The City is by default cached for 1 day (24 hours) so that subsequent requests are faster. This is configurable should your needs be more frequent.
